# ARCHIVE of 8800 Blue Lick Rd.

After seeing [Strange Aeons'](https://www.youtube.com/@STRANGEONS) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzgQtBpFB4o) on 8880 Blue Lick Rd. I found [MapleAtMorning's](https://github.com/MapleAtMorning) [repository](https://github.com/MapleAtMorning/8800-blue-lick) capturing a [working archive](https://mapleatmorning.com/8800-blue-lick/my.matterport.com/show/index.html) of the original Matterport tour.

I couldn't resist building a dedicated application for the data. So here it is!
