  # Note: GitHub Pages deployment is disabled because the project contains
  # 823MB of Matterport assets (textures, models) which exceed practical
  # deployment limits. This project is designed as a self-contained static
  # archive and requires alternative hosting (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, or
  # a custom CDN) for the large asset files.
  #
  # To enable deployment:
  # 1. Move assets to a CDN (jsDelivr, Cloudflare, etc.)
  # 2. Update asset URLs in the app to use the CDN
  # 3. Uncomment the deploy job below
